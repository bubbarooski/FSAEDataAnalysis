# What is Formula SAE?
Formula SAE (or FSAE) is student competition in which schools must build a formula style car to compete in multiple different events, including both dynamic driving-style events and static presentation-style events. The competition is very much an engineering focused event, with nearly every part of the car designed or mathematically proven by students. The car is equipped with a race-grade ECU and dozens of sensors that output data up to nearly 100 times per second. This allows us to analyze our events from competition or seperate testing sessions to try and make the car better. Ive attached a couple pictures below; one of me in the car and the other during one of the events!
