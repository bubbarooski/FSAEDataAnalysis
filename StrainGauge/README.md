## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to collect strain data from our suspension to justify and verfy the switch from steel suspension arms to carbon fiber suspenion arms. The team could've just bought generically sized carbon tubes that could be justified with math but that would be hard to defend to judge in our compeition and we would most likely be spending more money than needed to. Precise infomation is important to make sure the car can support its own weight, survive a crash with a cone, and keep the driver safe. There were multiple reasons this was done including weight and advances in team usage of composite materials. This was a collaboration between the frame engineer and I.
