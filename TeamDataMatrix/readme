--Purpose
The purpose of this project was to show how our team did in each individual event in comparision to other teams. These graphs are then analyzed as a team to help determine where the team is weak, where the team is strong, and where we can most focus our efforts.

--Data
The data for this project was sourced directly from the FSAE website as a PDF and contains the score for each team and the scores for each event. The PDF was uploaded into Excel and formatted for ease of use.

--Graphs
Each event is graphed with the total score on the x-axis and the respective event on the y-axis. Each graph is fully interactive; it can be zoomed in and out and certain ranges can be specified via mouse. For each graph, if a team did not post a score in that repsective event, they are excluded from the graph to make the data more accurate. The location of UNF for each event is marked with a star. A OLS regression line is added to each graph to see a potential correlation between the total score and the score of each event. The regression line is also interactive. 

--Analysis
When looking at the events, it seems as though a majority of events don't show a strong correlation between individual event score and overall score. Endurance shows a strong correlation (at .841) but, it is also the event worth the most points. What can be gleamed from this is that if a team competes in and finished the endurance event, there is a strong chance that they will place well. Another interesting observation is that both the acceleration event and skidpad event have a similar coefficient of determination (at .431 and .428 respectively) yet skidpad is worth less points overall. Looking at the events, acceleration is simply a timed drag style event while skidpad is a timed figure eight of sorts, that requires a car with good cornering/turning ability. Endurance, mentioned earlier, is a longer course that has a lot of tight turns, meaning that a car that can corner faster will usually do better. It seems there is a potential correlation between skidpad scores and endurance scores, which will be investigated further.
